## **Aim**

To explore and understand the various prompting techniques used for generating videos using AI models.

---

## **Algorithm**

1. Familiarize yourself with video generation models.
2. Create simple prompts for video generation.
3. Experiment with detailed prompts.
4. Add time and motion elements.
5. Test different video styles.
6. Iterate and adjust prompts.
7. Generate multiple versions.
8. Save and compare outputs.

## **Procedure**

### **1. Familiarize Yourself with Video Generation Models**

Explore AI tools capable of generating videos from text prompts:

* Runway Gen-2
* Synthesia
* Pictory
* DeepBrain AI

Understand their capabilities, limitations, output duration, style options, and supported features before starting.

### **2. Create Simple Prompts for Video Generation**

Begin with basic prompts to observe how AI interprets simple actions.

**Example Prompt:**

```
A person walking in a park.
```

**Output Video:**

---

### **3. Experiment with More Detailed Prompts**

Gradually increase the complexity by adding environmental details and actions.

**Example Prompt:**

```
A person in a red jacket walking along a sunny park path,
with birds flying in the sky and a dog running beside them.
```

**Output Video:**

---

### **4. Add Time and Motion Elements**

Include elements such as transitions, time-lapse, or camera movement.

**Example Prompt:**

```
A time-lapse video of the sun setting over the ocean, with the camera slowly
zooming out from the beach, capturing the waves and changing sky colors.
```

**Output Video:**

---

### **5. Test Different Video Styles**

Experiment with different genres such as animated, cinematic, artistic, or futuristic.

**Example Prompt:**

```
An animated scene of a futuristic city at night, with glowing neon lights,
flying cars, and a bustling crowd.
```

**Output Video:**

---

### **6. Iterate and Adjust Prompts**

Review the output and refine your prompt for improved clarity or motion control.

**Example Prompt (Refined):**

```
A cinematic shot of a car speeding through a neon-lit city at night,
reflections on the wet street, and a high-speed chase scene captured with dynamic camera angles.
```
