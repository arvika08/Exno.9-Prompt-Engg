## **Procedure**

### **1. Familiarize Yourself with Video Generation Models**

Explore AI tools capable of generating videos from text prompts:

* Runway Gen-2
* Synthesia
* Pictory
* DeepBrain AI

Understand their capabilities, limitations, output duration, style options, and supported features before starting.

### **2. Create Simple Prompts for Video Generation**

Begin with basic prompts to observe how AI interprets simple actions.

**Example Prompt:**

```
A person walking in a park.
```

---

### **3. Experiment with More Detailed Prompts**

Gradually increase the complexity by adding environmental details and actions.

**Example Prompt:**

```
A person in a red jacket walking along a sunny park path, with birds flying in the sky and a dog running beside them.
```

**Output Video:**

---

### **4. Add Time and Motion Elements**

Include elements such as transitions, time-lapse, or camera movement.

**Example Prompt:**

```
A time-lapse video of the sun setting over the ocean, with the camera slowly zooming out from the beach, capturing the waves and changing sky colors.
```

**Output Video:**

---

### **5. Test Different Video Styles**

Experiment with different genres such as animated, cinematic, artistic, or futuristic.

**Example Prompt:**

```
An animated scene of a futuristic city at night, with glowing neon lights, flying cars, and a bustling crowd.
```

**Output Video:**

---

### **6. Iterate and Adjust Prompts**

Review the output and refine your prompt for improved clarity or motion control.

**Example Prompt (Refined):**

```
A cinematic shot of a car speeding through a neon-lit city at night, reflections on the wet street, and a high-speed chase scene captured with dynamic camera angles.
```

### **7. Generate Multiple Versions**

Create slightly varied prompts to compare how the model changes the video style or sequence.

**Example Versions:**

* Change lighting
* Change character appearance
* Change camera direction
* Change motion speed

**Output Comparison:**
👉 *(Paste your videos / thumbnails here)*
`![Version1](paste-link)`
`![Version2](paste-link)`
`![Version3](paste-link)`

---

### **8. Save and Compare Outputs**

Observe differences in:

* Motion consistency
* Video sharpness
* Character continuity
* Scene style
* Prompt sensitivity

👉 *(Paste your comparison screenshots or notes here)*

---

## **Result**

The prompting techniques for video generation were explored successfully, and various video outputs were generated, refined, compared, and documented.
